What a turnout! We saw over 1000 of you, and that blows our collective minds. Here are the stats for #ToxicBBQ 2025:

- 810 burgers (+80 meatless)
- 500 hot dogs
- 100 lbs tomatoes, onion, lettuce
- 40 lbs grapes, corn, other veg
- 4 actual dogs
- 1 vole
- Plus Peppercon, Hot Ones flights, Cheesecon and a fuel pump repair on site!

We understand the line turned back some, the heat kept others from coming out, but we’re already planning on how to make next year even better. QSO party? More samples in the line? Maybe some lab-grown meat to try? Who knows what we’ll see, or what you’ll bring. Thanks for making this one awesome!

Join the humans of Vegas at the next inCARNEtion of your Thursday welcome party.  Enjoy fewer walls and more garden as we meet AFK in the shade of Sunset Park. Burgers and dogs are provided; you bring everything else (specialties, drinks, labor, and donations). We're expanding our grills to over 40 sq ft of heat with space for veggies and your own personal creations.

Contribute more food and drinks, staff the grill, join supply runs, or donate cash to help cover costs. Relax under the trees and conversate with new and old friends. Come be a part of what makes this cookout something to remember year after year.

- [Homebrew Exhibition](/homebrew): Bring your finest bitters, ciders, wine, and assorted preparations for a fermented face off.
- Open Grill: Bring your favorite and most exotic cuts, then grill it just how you like on our expanded grill space.
- Have an Idea? It's a big park. Reach out and we'll find a way to make it happen
